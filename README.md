## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Husky and lint-staged

This project uses both husky and lint-staged, in conjunction with a robust eslint and prettier setup to maintain opinionated coding standards on _pre-commit_. So... when you commit to Github, the process runs, checks for linting errors and auto formats based on the prettier/eslint rules set in the repo.

\*\*If the process does not run for you when first cloning the repo, open the `.husky/pre-commit` file and save it. I'm not sure why you need to do this but seems to be the only way to get it to work upon cloning. Let me know if you have any issues.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

This Project is setup to auto deploy on merge to `main` branch and generate a preview link (as a github comment) using `vercel-actions` in separate Github actions.

## For Github actions to work properly:

### Be sure to update environment variables in your Vercel project:

- *NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION \_the current date of setting up your project*
- *NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET \_set in the Sanity dashboard, usually someting like "development".  In vercel, set 2 of the same name, one for production, and one for pre-production environments*
- *SANITY_API_DEPLOY_TOKEN \_set in the Sanity dashboard, under "API -> Tokens"*
- *NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID \_Found at the top of the Sanity dashboard inside your project*

### Be sure to set secrets in your Github repo (settings -> Secrets and Variables -> Actions):

**All Of the above set in Vercel, as well as:**

- VERCEL_TOKEN _created in vercel account settings -> Tokens_
- GITHUB_TOKEN _this is autogenerated by Github_
- ORG_ID _if in a team, this is the Team_ID_
- PROJECT_ID _vercel project id, found in settings of the project (not the Sanity project token)_
